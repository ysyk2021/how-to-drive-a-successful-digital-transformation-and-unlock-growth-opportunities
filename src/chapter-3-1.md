Creating a digital strategy is critical to achieving success in digital transformation. It provides a roadmap for how the organization will leverage digital technology to achieve its goals and objectives. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of creating a digital strategy.

Assess Your Current State

The first step in creating a digital strategy is assessing your organization's current state. This includes evaluating your existing technology, processes, culture, and skill sets. This assessment will help identify areas where digital transformation can have the greatest impact.

Define Your Goals and Objectives

Once you have assessed your current state, the next step is defining your goals and objectives. Your goals and objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). They should align with the overall vision and goals of your organization.

Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) is critical to measuring the success of your digital strategy. KPIs should be tied to your goals and objectives and should be measurable. They should also be regularly tracked and analyzed to ensure that your digital strategy is on track.

Develop a Roadmap

Developing a roadmap is another important step in creating a digital strategy. The roadmap should outline the steps needed to achieve your defined goals and objectives. It should include timelines, milestones, and KPIs to track progress.

Establish Governance and Change Management Processes

Establishing governance and change management processes is critical to ensuring the successful implementation of your digital strategy. This includes creating a governance structure to oversee digital initiatives and establishing change management processes to ensure that changes are effectively communicated and implemented across the organization.
